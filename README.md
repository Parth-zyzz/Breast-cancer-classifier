Overview
Welcome to the Breast Cancer Classifier project! This repository implements a machine learning model to classify breast cancer diagnoses using three different algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression. Our goal is to provide an easy-to-use tool for early detection of breast cancer, helping healthcare professionals make informed decisions.

Features
Multiple Algorithms: Compare KNN, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression to determine the best performing model for breast cancer classification.
Data Visualization: Explore data distributions and model performance through intuitive visualizations.
Easy to Use: Simple command-line interface to load data and run classifications.
Model Evaluation: Comprehensive metrics to evaluate model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-classifier.git
cd breast-cancer-classifier
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data
This project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. You can download it from UCI Machine Learning Repository or include it in your local setup.

Usage
Prepare the dataset by placing it in the data/ directory.
Run the classification scripts:
bash
Copy code
python classify.py --algorithm knn
python classify.py --algorithm naive_bayes
python classify.py --algorithm logistic_regression
Evaluation
After running the classification, view the evaluation metrics in the output logs, including confusion matrices and classification reports.
